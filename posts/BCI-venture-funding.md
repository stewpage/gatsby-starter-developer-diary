*Can following the money tell us about the interface between academic
research and venture-funded companies in BCI. Is there a clear boundary
at all? What does the 'funding lens' reveal, about who is moving the
field forward? How far along are the new BCI companies compared with
the incumbent neural interfaces?*


Funding is a measure of potential, and
occasionally a predictor of success. Regardless, tracking investment in
brain-computer interfaces is a useful way to assess how the new
generation of BCI developers stacks up. Interest in BCI has been growing,
and we're likely to see a new wave of investments in 2020 and beyond.
Here is the picture in August 2020, ahead of Neuralink's
second big announcement.

At first glance, it seems like European companies get funded to do
invasive medical applications and US companies work on consumer
applications with the notable exceptions of Paradromics and Neuralink.
This is probably not true. Many US research efforts towards invasive BCI
— like '[Braingate](https://www.braingate.org/)', perhaps the most
advanced BCI in human trials today — are structured as academic
groups. Across the Atlantic, companies tend to spin off or license out
technology developed in universities before human trials.

Companies in the Bay Area are highlighted as a separate group, because
of the sheer number of BCI ventures headquartered there, and because
these ventures have different levels of access to funding compared to
those elsewhere in the US. However, that label may not be fully
accurate. For example, Paradromics was started up in Silicon Valley and
subsequently moved to Austin, Texas. Similarly, Emotiv started up in
Australia and subsequently set up headquarters in San Francisco.

'[Kernel](https://www.kernel.co/)' stands out in its own 'Research
Devices' category. The company provides 'Neuroscience as a Service
(NaaS) gives you on-demand access to our world-leading brain recording
technology.', allowing clients to perform non-invasive neuroscience
experiments remotely through it's 'Flow' and 'Flux' platforms.

But Kernel is not alone in catering to the research community.
'[Blackrock](https://www.blackrockmicro.com/),
[Ripple](https://rippleneuro.com/), [TDT](https://www.tdt.com/), and
[Plexon](https://plexon.com/) all produce products, components, and
services for BCI research. These include lab electrophysiology
equipment, FDA-cleared microelectrode arrays for human implantation,
custom BCI development services, human BCI implanted arrays, including
consulting services, and technology for optogenetic stimulation. These
are privately owned, but with little information on funding available
many seemed to have originated as spinoffs from university research
groups. It seems that following the money does not always reveal where
new technology is being developed.
'[Neuropixels](https://www.neuropixels.org/)', a publicly funded
research and engineering effort that developed a popular silicon CMOS
digital neural probe, also deserves a mention in the 'research devices'
category.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, neuroscience researchers will
attest to the contribution of community-developed efforts like
[OpenBCI](https://openbci.com/), who develop widely used open-source
non-invasive BCI tools and [Open Ephys](https://open-ephys.org/), an
organization that consolidates open-source software efforts into [tools
that are used by the likes of
Neuralink](https://twitter.com/OpenEphys/status/1151538834821115904) and
advocates for common open standards that move the field forward. These
organizations are fundamental to moving BCI research forward, but not
visible at all when you use the 'funding' lens to look at the field.

Even companies like
[Neuralink](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html) who purport
to want to eventually build a consumer device, are building medical
devices first. Let's narrow the focus to invasive neural interfaces for
medical use and include some of the older neural interfaces that were
conceptualized in the 1990s and early 2000s.

Technology that requires surgery to implant an interface that will stay
in the body for years, stimulating or recording from the nervous system
throughout its lifetime requires approval from regulators. This involves
years of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials to demonstrate that
the implants and the surgical procedure are safe. Developers of invasive
neural interfaces follow a different path from developers of consumer
devices.

The technology that the newer ventures like
[Paradromics](https://paradromics.com/) are building may be light years
ahead of the large sensing leads and relatively imprecise neural
stimulators that are currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of
[epilepsy](https://www.neuropace.com/), [Parkinson's
disease](https://www.neuromodulation.abbott/us/en/hcp/products/dbs-movement-disorders/st-jude-medical-infinity-dbs-system.html),
[heart failure](https://www.cvrx.com/) or [chronic
pain](https://www.nevro.com/English/en/home/default.aspx). Their paths
to commercialization, however, will depend strongly on the outcomes of
their clinical trials. In this sense, they are closer to these incumbent
medical device manufacturers, and to developers of
[motor](http://www.clinatec.fr/), [sensory](https://www.sensars.com/),
and
[visual](https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/video/cracking-the-code-to-treat-blindness-1385480259560)
neuroprosthetics. Hopefully, the newer generation of BCI devices will
have shorter timelines before clinical use, with FDA [announcing its
support](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-md-efforts-spur-development-innovative-devices-including)
for BCI devices and putting out
[guidelines](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/implanted-brain-computer-interface-bci-devices-patients-paralysis-or-amputation-non-clinical-testing)
for their trials.

To shed more light on how these technologies are brought to life, it's
useful to dig deeper into where the technology is developed and
commercialized. All technology builds on previous discoveries. Some
inventions are explicitly transferred from the research world to the
commercial sphere through 'technology transfer agreements' or licenses.
It's not unusual for the initial R&D to be done through a research
consortium and handed over to a commercial entity who is responsible for
bringing it to market. This can also be done through a 'spin-off' from a
university.

For example, the Australian Federal Government awarded a [\$42
million](https://bionicvision.org.au/) grant to a research consortium
called Bionic Vision Australia to develop bionic vision technology. The
technology was later transferred to [Bionic Vision
Technologies](https://bionicvis.com/), who went on to raise \$18 million
from private funders, presumably to further clinical trials and further
development.

In the case of BCI, it appears that the 'wearables' or non-invasive
consumer BCI products are mostly built in-house at tech companies. The
medical neural interfaces or the 'implantables' have are more likely to
be developed in a university lab and transferred or spun out for
commercialization after a certain degree of success has been proven.

</script>

Public institutions are closely linked with neural interface research
and development globally. More than 60% of the 36 neural interface
companies either build directly on technology licensed from a university
or receive public funding in the form of grants for research and
clinical trials. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the US
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), the European Commission's
Executive Agency for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (EASME) and the
European FP-7 R&D programs have all been significant funders of BCI and
continue to award grants to further the technology.

<iframe title="Involvement of DARPA" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-SnuTH" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SnuTH/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="452"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

Another notable agency involved deeply in United States BCI development
is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA. About half of
invasive neural interface technology companies in the US are directly or
indirectly funded by DARPA. The agency has taken an interest in BCI
development for decades and [continues to
fund](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/bionics/darpa-funds-ambitious-neurotech-program)
its development.


With the 'Elon Musk spotlight' that is currently on the field,
brain-computer interfaces are likely to see an uptick in investor and
researcher interest over the next few years. Hopefully, this means that
new safe and more effective technology will come to market soon.
