*The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency invests millions in
brain-computer interface projects every year, effectively driving the
BCI research agenda. This post catalogs the various programs and their
recipients, tracking DARPA's investments over the decades*


Nobody has funded the BCI research and development with as much
sustained energy as DARPA. Almost every advance or major technology in
the field can be traced back to DARPA funding to the researchers.
Neuralink's '[sewing
machine'](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/252124/20200828/neuralink-machine-will-sew-many-1-024-impossibly-thin-5.htm)
surgical robot can be traced to the 5-year \$70M SUBNETs program, the
initial concept for the
[Stentrode](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/stentrode-melbourne-upper-limb-paralysis/)
was funded by the RE-NET program, and the prosthetic limbs used by early
Braingate trials were funded by the 'Revolutionizing Prosthetics'
program. Startups like Nia Therapeutics, Paradromics, and the recently
acquired Iota Biosciences also owe DARPA either for direct investment
or for funding of the underlying technology

The Agency funds multi-million-dollar research programs that typically
last 4 years and have very specific ambitious goals. DARPA announces programs
publicly, and candidates compete individually or by
forming consortia to develop competitive proposals. Successful awardees
or recipients are called 'performers'. The research that is funded
usually shapes the future of the entire field for a few years.

The overarching goals of DARPA research funding for BCI are

-   Augmenting the cognitive capabilities of its US armed forces
    personnel

-   Mitigating the human consequences of armed conflict by developing
    solutions like prosthetic limbs or PTSD therapies.

Almost all programs fall into one of these two categories, but DARPA has
also funded a considerable amount of basic neurotechnology research to
meet these goals. The military may or may not use the results, but the
technology often finds its way into the general
public sphere, benefitting the global neuroscience community.
Occasionally, investors, corporates, or billionaires pick up promising
tech to commercialize it further. Neuralink and Stentrode are on their
way to human trials, working with the FDA, but not all DARPA-funded
projects succeed. Kernel's [early
efforts](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-race-to-build-a-brain-machine-interface/)
with invasive prosthetics that stemmed from the DARPA-funded REMIND program,
were quickly dropped in favor of more consumer-friendly wearables.

Sometimes, DARPA drops programs midway or changes their names, leaving
little trace. The 'Accelerated learning' program on tDCS is an example,
with press reports and presentations explaining the goals, only for the
program to drop off the DARPA website entirely. Conspiracy theories
about DARPA and BCI research abound, but most of these information gaps
can be chalked up to changes in policy or strategic direction, or just
research efforts that didn't pan out.


DARPA BCI Programs through the decades
======================================

DARPA's strategic interest in BCI started in the 1960s, when JCR
Licklider, the first director of the Information Processing Techniques
Office (IPTO) published his vision of 'man-computer symbiosis'. The
first batch of funding was in 1974, under a program called
*Close-Coupled Man/Machine Systems*, later renamed *Biocybernetics*. The
*Biocybernetics* program is documented in places with forbidding names
like 'The Black Vault', but it's not clear at all that there were any
sinister intentions behind it. The [documents on
*Biocybernetic*s](https://documents2.theblackvault.com/documents-5/dod/readingroom/6/877.pdf)
are a great read, explaining how DARPA funded universities for research
on EEG, EMG, pupillometry, event-related potentials, MEG, and related
technology. They also are surprisingly candid, admitting to burocatic
missteps, funding lapses, and a 'checkered history reflecting
programmatic, organizational and personnel changes at DARPA'. The
*Biocybernetics* program was the first consequential BCI funding in an
era when all brain science was 'psychophysiolocial', and most notably
led to the discovery of event-related potentials and the P300 component.

The 1980s and 90s are devoid of any documented DARPA investment in this
technology, but DARPA's interest picked up again in 2002 and has since
grown considerably. DARPA funded both Invasive and non-invasive BCI
research in the 2000s, under the umbrella of the AugCog and HAND
programs. The HAND program was especially broad in its goals, with
funding stretching from 2002 well into 2015.

In the late 2000s, DARPA started to expand and split up this funding
into multiple, more specific programs. The *Revolutionizing Prosthetics*
was one of the biggest and most successful, leading to the development
of modern functional prosthetics. DARPA also invested heavily in memory
enhancement and recovery through the *RAM*, *RAM-Replay*, and *REMIND*
programs. Around the same time, another set of programs — *Silent
Talk*, *Accelerated Learning*, *NIA*, *CT2WS* — were all funded to improve performance at various cognitive tasks, and
communicating non-invasively with machines. Another program, RE-NET,
funded basic and translational research to solve the problem of
long-term stability of neural interfaces. The current decade has seen
more focus on peripheral interfaces, with the *Electrx*, *HAPTIX*, and
*TNT* programs.

While each new program manager redefines priorities, DARPA seems to
learn from any failures and adapt accordingly. New programs have
started focusing on cooperation with FDA early in the R&D process, and
calls for proposals now routinely emphasize ethical, legal, and social
aspects of the technology. New programs have clear goals for paths to
human use — for both invasive and non-invasive technology. Having
observed that it will take decades before invasive brain implants can be
used in healthy individuals, DARPA is now also focusing on
investments in non-invasive or '[minutely
invasive'](https://www.darpa.mil/program/next-generation-nonsurgical-neurotechnology)
technology for these applications.

The People Behind the Programs — DARPA Program Managers
========================================================

Each DARPA program is the brainchild of a program manager. These are
powerful and interesting figures, handpicked for their role, which is to
set ambitious goals for BCI technology and to shape its research
trajectory. They have a limited tenure at DARPA- typically 4 years, but
most make their mark on the field during that time. One of the best ways
to learn about DARPA programs is to listen to DARPA program managers,
where they explain how they got the job, why they picked the priority
areas they did, and learn how DARPA works. DARPA hosts a podcast
series, where program manager [Eric Van
Gieson](https://blubrry.com/voices_from_darpa/60546558/episode-26-the-eclectic-biotechnician/)
has been featured speaking about some current programs. The Neural
Implant Podcast has also hosted 40-minute interviews with DARPA program
managers [Jack
Judy](https://neuralimplantpodcast.com/dr-jack-judy-on-working-at-darpa-the-hype-cycle-and-a-bioelectronic-medicine-center),
the architect of the RE-NET program, and [Doug
Weber](https://neuralimplantpodcast.com/dr-douglas-weber-on-his-work-at-darpa-neuroprosthetics-and-bioelectronic-medicine),
who speaks about his enthusiasm for peripheral interfaces.

Who gets DARPA funding?
======================

Over the decades, the profile of DARPA BCI research 'performers' has
also evolved. In the early 2000s, most BCI contracts went to large
corporations — think Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Booz Allen Hamilton —
but the newer programs are more focused on universities. In recent years
DARPA has funded several small businesses or startups, most notably
[Paradromics in
2017](https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/10/darpa-nesd-grants-paradromics/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAEnrGfHnGx6pvWZ02k42rq5gD_3gmGfiRA66gDd3fcmVY-ixZoo-95mA8ACBnABtmlvSnNPohshB1cgmXQhZ1wFduAlOZPz9V2j1-3LpR7IKJKwPfVvJpZypHmi7PRw5HDfdVPkuZce7rFFTNYtqT-S__vC1EWBbI_Z3tzlzvcQ).
Performers are almost always are from the United States, with a few
exceptions, such as the Stentrode funding to the University of
Melbourne.

DARPA contracts are large and many recipients are large consortia.
Universities and corporations often partner to receive funds and
sub-contract them. For example, the *Revolutionizing Prosthetics*
program was led by two teams of investigators, DEKA and The Johns
Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL). DEKA worked
with two universities and a private developer, while APl subcontracted to
nineteen primary level contractors (universities and private companies) with
ten second-tier subcontractors and collaborators from six countries
overall. Of late the number of recipients is smaller, even for large
grants.

DARPA also funds BCI research outside these named programs, through
mechanisms like open calls and small business innovation grants.

Conclusion
==========

There is no other agency in the world that funds neurotechnology
research with the unmitigated focus that DARPA does. It's no wonder
 that their funding has driven the research agenda for neural
interfaces for decades. It's anybody's guess what DARPA's next BCI
program will fund, but the agency is certain to continue to steer the
BCI community's research efforts for many years to come.
